# Hands-On-TensorBoard-for-PyTorch-Developers [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On TensorBoard for PyTorch Developers [Video]]( https://www.packtpub.com/data/hands-on-tensorboard-for-pytorch-developers-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github ). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
TensorBoard is a visualization library for TensorFlow that plots training runs, tensors, and graphs. TensorBoard has been natively supported since the PyTorch 1.1 release. In this course, you will learn how to perform Machine Learning visualization in PyTorch via TensorBoard. This course is full of practical, hands-on examples. You will begin with a quick introduction to TensorBoard and how it is used to plot your PyTorch training models. You will learn how to write TensorBoard events and run TensorBoard with PyTorch to obtain visualizations of the training progress of a neural network. You will visualize scalar values, images, text and more, and save them as events. You will log events in PyTorch–for example, scalar, image, audio, histogram, text, embedding, and back-propagation.
By the end of the course, you will be confident enough to use TensorBoard visualizations in PyTorch for your real-world projects.<br/>
